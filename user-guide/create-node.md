## How to create a Node

There should be a sidebar on the right of your screen containing a list of all the services you can creates nodes for. If you don't have the sidebar, click on the little square on the top left of your screen (to the left of the "Home > Playground" text) to open it.

You can then scroll the list of available services to find the one you seek. Once this is done, click on the arrow to the right of the service name. It will open a list of all available actions for this service.

Put your mouse on top of the action you desire to use, click and drag your mouse to the canvas. You can then release your mouse. The node should appear on your canvas.

To get more informations about an action, you can click on its name. It will open a panel on the right of your screen with a description of the Node.

## A little Node guide

A Node, upon addition to the canvas, will show these elements :

- The logo of the service at the center of the node,
- The name of the action displayed below it,
- A rectangle to the left of the Node if it can take an input,
- A round to the right of the Node if it can give an output.
